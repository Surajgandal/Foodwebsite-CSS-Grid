					   Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
					   typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
					   standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an 
					   unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
					   it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
					   five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
					   remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
					   with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
					   passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
					   like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

					   Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for 
					  an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and
					  contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins,
					  vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and
					  assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life,
					  or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding
					  behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often
					  evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
